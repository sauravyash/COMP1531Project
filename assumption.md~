Channels Assumptions:

For channels_list:
- Valid token (input)
- Valid channels 
- Channels & associated details correctly linked to User ID
- User is authorised to view channels in list
- User token is correctly matched to User ID
- List displays all information (not just some of the channels, etc.)
- Function returns a list (an empty list if no channels are found)
- User is able to view private channels they are a member/ admin of.

For channels_listall:
- Valid token (input)
- If this is used to view all channels for admin and server purposes:
    - Admin privileges are required to view all public & private channels.
    - Internal server has admin privileges.
- If this is used to view channels that a User may join/ for navigation:
    - User can only view public channels/ private channels they are a member of.
- Function returns a list (an empty list if no channels are found)

For channels_create:
- Valid token (input)
- Valid name (input)- no empty string, <= 20 characters long.
- Valid is_public vari
That token is valid, that name is valid, that is_public variable is valid. (basically all input is valid lol)
Cannot be an Empty String
Token must be unique
That an input error occurs when shit goes wrong (with the name)
That it creates a channel with the correct details
That the channel is set as either public or private 
That no other channel token with the same string exists maybe???
Token is unique, not name ahhh ok
Token == unique identifier :)
That this channel is linked to the creator of the channel (as an admin)- This might be a part of a diff function later on though..?
